from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include


urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path("", include('blog.urls')), #blog is the folder of the app and urls is the file the holds the urls.
    #I'll leave the empty path now because I want to keep the blog app as the main app for now.
    #But in the future, I might want to add more apps to this project.
